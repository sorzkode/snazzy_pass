# snazzy_pass

![alt text](https://github.com/sorzkode/snazzy_pass/blob/main/spsc.png?raw=true)

A simple random password generator built with tkinter GUI

Download and run snazzy_pass.py to run the program

    Select your password length
    Select the number of special charactors you want to include
    Selectthe number of digits you want to include
    Click "GO"

Includes a copy button that copies the password to your clipboard and a reset button that clears the generated pass

Please note: This was my first Python project that was meant for personal educational purposes.

I may add more features as I go and plan on releasing a CLI version of it. Since there aren't enough password generators out there ;P

Sincerely, 
sorzkode
